# Summary

In an era where it can be argued that all biology is computational biology [@Markowetz2017],
 it is increasingly important to properly manage computational analyses and data in order to
 ensure the reproducibility of *in silico* experiments. A major aspect of best practices in 
 scientific computing [@wilson2017good] is managing the **provenance** of data. Provenance
 can be broadly defined as the "description of the origins of an artefact and the processes
 which produced it" (adapted from [@Buneman2001]).
